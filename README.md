# Custom Tk-Inter

Pet projects written in Custom Tk-inter, a modern python GUI library based on Tkinter. These apps were written as an intro to GUI programming in python. The first of these is a BMI calculator meant to be run locally, and the second is a graphical interface to query GhatGPT using an API key. 

Such endevours were ultimately abandoned after the discovery of web-based applications (Taipy, Gradio, Streamlit)to achieve the same result with less convoluted code.
